Build Environment: Ubuntu Oracle VM VirtualBox

[Github] https://github.com/austinahmau/CS219_Project2

In this project, we were tasked to read from our provided textfile following the format **operator** **operand1** **operand2**, implement the 9 bitwise operations on the operands, store the answers as an unsigned 32-bit number using **uint32_t**, and display the answers in hexidecimal to the screen.

## Installation

I will describe the build tools I used in the virtual box until I switch over to a better coding environment as I have been told we will not be running code in the Oracle VM VirtualBox.
